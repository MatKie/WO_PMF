This assumes you have a pre-assembled (if you like also preequilibrated)
single micelle as a gro file (fitting to whatever you put in your
topology). solvate it in the water model you like:

Replace the path in -cs with whereever you have a pre-equilibrated water 
box (e.g. a box of 216 water molecules). gromacs looks for this file in 
whereever all the forcefields are (e.g. /usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/top/)

Make sure you get roughly as many water as you expect. There are around 33.3 
waters per nm^3, half for the two bead water model I'm using here. 
The box is 1000nm^3, so I expect 16650 water beads. If it's too far away, 
play with the -radius keyword (or set -maxsol)

gmx solvate -cp single_micelle.gro -cs cgw2.gro  -o solv.gro -p ../topo/topol.top
