If you want another solute, put it in the folder and update
it water_alkane.inp. Also update the numbers in water_oil according to 
instructions in topol folder. 
Run packmol on water_alkane.inp. For me this is usually something like:

~/packmol/packmol < water_alkane.inp

This should create water_alkane.pdb
