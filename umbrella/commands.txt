Upload to cx1/hpc and run
run ./check_frames.sh to see if everything has finished, maybe restart some 
frames (check out the *.sh files in here there are some to check completion,
restart incomplete or errorenous simulations.)

run ./collect frames.sh to get relevant information

copy frames.dat from pull_analysis to analysis. 

-b 20: discard some of the trajectory (200ps?)
-nBootstrap 100 : do 100 bootstraps
-bs-method traj: trajectory method for bootstrapping, creating new data
                 from the sampled data taking the autocorrelation time
                 into account. IMO best for the situation where we have
                 one simulation for each COM distance.
-ac yes: Estimate autocorrelation time from each window.
-temp: temp

gmx wham -temp 298.15 -b 200 -nBootstrap 100 -bs-method traj -ac yes -it tpr-files.dat -if force-files.dat -unit kT
    Optional -min -max (in nm), different kT/kJ
