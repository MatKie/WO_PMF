Upload to cx1/hpc and run
run ./check_frames.sh to see if everything has finished, maybe restart some 
frames (check out the *.sh files in here there are some to check completion,
restart incomplete or errorenous simulations.)

run ./collect frames.sh to get relevant information
If, prior to this, you create lhs.txt and rhs.txt including the windows 
left and right of the zero point (if symm.) this also prepares files 
to look at the two sides of the symm. profile. 

copy frames.dat from pull_analysis to analysis. 

-b 20: discard some of the trajectory (200ps?)
-nBootstrap 100 : do 100 bootstraps
-bs-method traj: trajectory method for bootstrapping, creating new data
                 from the sampled data taking the autocorrelation time
                 into account. IMO best for the situation where we have
                 one simulation for each COM distance.
-ac yes: Estimate autocorrelation time from each window.
-temp: temp

gmx wham -temp 298.15 -b 200 -nBootstrap 100 -bs-method traj -ac yes -it tpr-files.dat -if force-files.dat -unit kT
    Optional -min -max (in nm), different kT/kJ

Possibly to little data for bootstrap --> don't do one or do one of the hist ones.
for lhs add:
-it lhs-tpr-files.dat
-if lhs-force-files.dat
-hist histo_lhs.xvg -oiact iact_lhs.xvg -o profile_lhs.xvg -bsres  bsResult_lhs.xvg -bsprof bsProfs_lhs.xvg
for rhs add:
-it rhs-tpr-files.dat
-if rhs-force-files.dat
-hist histo_rhs.xvg -oiact iact_rhs.xvg -o profile_rhs.xvg -bsres  bsResult_rhs.xvg -bsprof bsProfs_rhs.xvg
