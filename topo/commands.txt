copy topol.top.example to topol.top
Change ffnonbonded.itp in topol.top to version you want

If you want a different surfactant, 
create an itp file and change it in topol.top
best is actually to copy the surfactant right at the beginning, after the 
includes because we we will need that later for the umbrella sims.
