run plot_force.py and check if force profile is alright.
Also check your nvt_plot trajectory with vmd.
in selection: residue xx xx ..., get xx from index file 

copy index.ndx from pull simulation
copy pull.tpr from pull simulation 
(cp ../nvt_pull/topol.tpr pull.tpr)

copy your *self-sufficient* topology in here. This means include molecule
(e.g. Hexane.itp) via copy&paste instead of just via include

./calc_distances.sh (change up call if necessary)

If there were blanks (in summary_distances.dat), fill those with values
Delete frames below/above your chosen threshold (e.g 6.5 nm each side)

Copy example mdp files and change temps in mdp files if necessary

Change pairdist call in GROMACS.sh and .mdp files if necessary
Pay special attention to the include directory

python2 setupUmbrella.py summary_distances.dat 0.1 GROMACS_UMBRELLA.sh run-umbrella.sh > frames.dat
This might need a negative dx, depending on signs in summary_distances.dat ...

mkdir runfiles
mv frame-* runfiles

create frames.raw (only frame numbers from frames.dat)
cd runfiles
chmod +x *.sh
while read line ; do ./frame-${line}_run-umbrella.sh ;done < ../frames.raw

copy frames.raw to umbrella and upload to cluse
Start there with start_frames.sh
