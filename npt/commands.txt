Change temperature or whatever and copy npt.mdp.example to npt.mdp
If you want to run local:

gmx grompp -f npt.mdp -c ../eq_npt/confout.gro -t ../eq_npt/traj.trr -p ../topo/topol.top -n ../em/index.ndx
gmx mdrun -v -s topol.tpr 

If you want to run on cx1:
gmx grompp -f npt.mdp -c ../eq_npt/confout.gro -t ../eq_npt/traj.trr -p ../topo/topol.top -n ../em/index.ndx
upload the whole folder to cx1, and qsub GROMACS.sh. You might have to adapt 
the GMXLIB path in there to the location of the tables.

ANALYSIS:
Create index_analysis.ndx which also includes some CM_CT group
gmx trjconv -f traj.trr -o traj.xtc -pbc cluster
cd analysis ; ./analyse.sh #make sure index_analysis has NA+ as group 9 and that everything is as expected
python Collect_data.py
